# Week NÂº 13

## Step by step, line by line â€” becoming a Full Stack Developer in one year.

ðŸ“… Week 13 completed â€“ Improved version of the To-Do List (based on Week 5's project).

### ðŸ§  What I do this week:

- Storing and retrieving data from `localStorage`.
- Rendering content conditionally based on task status (completed/pending).
- Using event delegation to handle interactions with dynamically generated elements.
- Building filter controls (All, Completed, Pending).
- Improving the user experience with CSS transitions and conditional classes.
- Creating clean and reusable functions for rendering and updating state.

### ðŸ’» Mini Project: To-Do List App â€” Version 2

This week's project is a **refactor and upgrade** of the basic To-Do List app created during **Week 5**.

While the original version allowed adding and deleting tasks using vanilla JavaScript, this improved version includes persistent storage, task status management, and a more dynamic user interface.
