# Week NÂº 13

## Step by step, line by line â€” becoming a Full Stack Developer in one year.

ðŸ“… Week 13 completed â€“ Improved version of the To-Do List (based on Week 5's project).

### ðŸ§  What I do this week:

This project is an improved version of the task manager built during **Week 5**. Itâ€™s a fully functional To-Do List built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to:

- Add new tasks.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed or pending.
- Delete individual tasks.
- Search for tasks by name.
- Filter tasks by status (all, completed, pending).
- View counters for total, pending, and completed tasks.
- Persist data using `localStorage`.

### ðŸš€ Improvements Over Week 5 Version

- **Edit mode** implemented for existing tasks.
- **Dynamic search** with partial matching.
- **Filter by status** (all, completed, pending).
- **Live counters** for better task overview.
- Cleaner and more modular code.
- Enhanced user experience with input focus and better UI feedback.
